# WWDC15-Scholarship

I was accepted!

This is the application I created for the WWDC 2015 scholarship. Please notice that I had to censor some information about me. Also sorry for the rough code. :(

I made use of a modified version of [@BalestraPatrick's](https://github.com/BalestraPatrick) skill progress bar.
